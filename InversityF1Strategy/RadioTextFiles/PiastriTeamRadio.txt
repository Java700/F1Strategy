I don't really know how I lost the front wing at the start to be honest but have a look. Thanks for all the effort. Yesterday was a very encouraging day so push on to Melbourne. Yeah, I mean you've done the whole race on one set of tyres pretty much so pace at the end was good, pace of the race was good but tyre management, everything's good in Melbourne so we'll try and put it all together. Oscar on Sunday there's that Park Vermeer thing as well so when you get to the FIA you need to turn the car fully off, that means kill the engine, wait five and then switch it fully off. Well done mate, I know that that's again not the result we wanted but the pace is there and it's coming. Yep, copy."}
